# Nonlinear-Control-for-Quadratic-Boost-Output-Voltage-Regulation
Controlling quadratic boost converters is challenging due to their quasi-quadratic voltage gain, limiting linear controllers or creating complex designs. This paper introduces a simple, easily implemented nonlinear control law for this converter. Simulations validate the proposed method's efficacy.
